My Book - Exercise for JavaScript, HTML and basic CSS
---------------------------------------------------------

Requirement
-----------

1. This UI design is just an outline to give you the feelers for what is needed. The idea is to workout and implement all the concepts you have learned in JavaScript.
You can be innovative on colors, design and any additional thoughts on the design/code will be a nice touch.

2. No Server is required. Use only HTML, Javascript and CSS. I should be able to open the file directly using a browser.
3. Modular directory structure must be there for feed, profile etc.
4. Separate CSS files should be used such as feed.css, profile.css and mybook.css
5. You do not have to use the background colors defined in wireframe instead use your creativity.
6. Proper source code comment on each method is required.
7. Use 'strict' in all JavaScript files.

Notes: 
------

All the notes below are only as a guidance, you have to do at least this. Doing more will be appreciated. The idea behind the following notes is to help 
you understand the requirements with more details. But the wireframes are more than good enough. If you think there are any flaws in it, feel free to improve.
